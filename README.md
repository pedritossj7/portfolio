# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Where you can find more about me and how able I am to demonstrate my skills :)

- The index page is the ONLY page to not include Bootstrap framework. Thers's only pure HTML and CSS.
- The rest of the pages were implemented with Bootstrap as well.
- In the "About Me" page, I've used also ChartJS to create the doughnut chart, where I show my skills.

## Ver. 4/10/2023/1
- More changes in the experience page: Photos included in their respective projects, encoded with BASE64 (I've implemented a GIF image to see how it goes, sorry for its bad quality ðŸ˜…).
