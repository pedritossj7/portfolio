# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Where you can find more about me and how able I am to demonstrate my skills :)

## Ver. 25/9/2023/1

- README implementation.
- The index page is the ONLY page to not include Bootstrap framework. Thers's only pure HTML and CSS.
- The rest of the pages were implemented with Bootstrap as well.
- In the "About Me" page, I've used also ChartJS to create the doughnut chart, where I show my skills.
- The experience page is now connected correctly to the "projects.json" file. In fact, more easy to implement a section in case I needed to put another project in mind.
