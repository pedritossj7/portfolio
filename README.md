# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Where you can find more about me and how able I am to demonstrate my skills :)

## Ver. 5/1/2024/1

- There will be changes in the entire webpage, as you can see at the index page. In the next version, the remaining sections (About, Experience and Contact) will be accesible. 
- All the pages were implemented with Bootstrap, and some things were modified with pure CSS as well.
- In the "About Me" page, I've used also ChartJS to create the doughnut chart, where I show my skills.
- The experience page is connected to the "projects.json" file. In fact, more easy to implement a section in case I needed to put another project in mind.
